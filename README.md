Remade the project from version one in React, I had some issues with the folders from the first one, so rather than creating as a new Branch, I remade it in a new repository.

To run the project and the server, you must be in the reactportfolio folder, here you can run "npm run dev", and "npm run dev:server".

I've set up the site to support some routing. The main page will show the projects are only set to be favourited, while the all projects will show projects that are favourited and not.

On the All projects page, I've added support to deleting the Projects, and you can also add a picture that in the future can be added to the project.

Currently there are no support to store the image, but I know the image is being captured by the server, this will be worked with further when I have more time.
